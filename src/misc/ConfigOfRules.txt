configure() function could be the standard for when you set the rule directly, so it's the thing you call to configure this rule directly, and then it means it should accept the Access Contorl address?

and then we can have a custom function, outside of the interface, that can have still an interface but not be part of the IUsernameRule, IGraphRule, I*Rule interfaces, but more like ICombinableRule interface, which has a method to configure that will not expect the Access Control, for example...

in any way, we cannot expect a random rule to work with the combinator out of the box, because as a simple argument, we expect them to be sharing the same access control storage

---

CON: you might have a rule that is pretty cool, that does not require any configuration, does not require any permission (thus, does not require any access control), and you cannot compose it through the combinator because it did not implement the ICombinableRule interface, while it still implements the IRule one with the classic configure function


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules can be set for a primitive in these ways, and must support each one of them:

    1. The impementation set directly.

    2. The implementation set with a proxy in between.
        2.1. Beacon proxy
        2.2. Transparent or Universal proxy
        2.3. Rule combinator proxy

So, depending on how you see it, it's two, three or four cases.

Probably because of how our code is written, we can think them as three cases:

    1. The impementation set directly.

    2. The implementation set with a classic proxy in between (Beacon, Transparent or Universal proxy)

    3. Rule combinator proxy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We should take into account that the configuration changes in the rules should be able to be tracked through events.

An Access Control change is really important, even sometimes more than a normal config change (e.g. use another ERC-20).
