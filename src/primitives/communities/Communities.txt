Communities:

+ Module to grant and revoke memberships. Options that can be implemented with this:
  - Single admin with full authority
  - Multiple admins with equal authority
  - Multiple admins but with a treshold (like a multisig)
  - Voting like a DAO formed by its current memebers
  - Token-gated (NFTs, ERC-20s), time-based, or other conditions
  - Fully permissionless, anyone can join, nobody can revoke
  - Etc.

+ Isolated/Exclusive Publishing system / Feed
  - This gives the option to enforce that only members can post/comment/etc into the community
  - Who can hide/moderate content? Similar logic to the membership system
    * Flagging like a DAO
    * Only a group of admins
    * Nobody
    * Etc.

+ Metadata for description, title, name, subtitle

+ Names, symbol
 - Like ERC-20/ERC-721, names can be repeated, people will give legitimacy to the best community
